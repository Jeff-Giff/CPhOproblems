# CPhOproblems
Problem set dedicated to contest physics. Can be read on obsidian.

扬中人自己的物理题集。

All problems should be submitted in Chinese.

Hierarchy: there are five folders for five branches of physics: mechanics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, optics and modern physics. Under each folder, there are different files for different subtopics and methods. Each file should contain a brief descrption of the topic(optional) and problem-solutions. Use H1 for section division, H2 for each problem and H3 for sub-parts of the problem.

我放了五个文件夹，里面每个文件对应一种模型。内容随意，文件就按太子的格式来吧，挺好的
